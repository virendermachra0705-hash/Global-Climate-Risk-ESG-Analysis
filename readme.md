# Global Climate Risk & ESG Data Analysis

### Problem Statement

Understanding how **climate risk, economic strength, and ESG performance** interact globally to drive sustainability.

### Objective

To create a **composite sustainability analysis system** that merges ESG, GDP, SDI, and Climate indicators â€” identifying top-performing nations and vulnerable economies.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
2. **EDA and Correlation Analysis**
3. **Composite Index Creation**
4. **Risk Scoring & Ranking**
5. **Predictive Modeling**
6. **Interactive Dashboards (Streamlit + Power BI)**

## Key Insights

- High GDP countries often maintain strong ESG scores, but not always climate-resilient.
- Small, high-SDI nations can outperform larger economies on sustainability.
- Climate risk has a visible inverse relationship with GDP growth and ESG stability.

## What I Learned

- End-to-end data analysis pipeline from cleaning to deployment.
- Building composite indices using normalization and weighted scoring.
- Storytelling using Power BI and Streamlit for sustainability insights.
- Connecting climate, economy, and ESG for real-world interpretation.
